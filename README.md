# Otp_Project_Using_MERN_Stack

This project is a beginner-level application built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. The application demonstrates fundamental concepts and skills for working with this technology stack. It features:

- **Backend**: A RESTful API using Express.js and Node.js, with MongoDB for data storage.
- **Frontend**: A React.js-based user interface with basic routing and state management.
- **Authentication**: Implementation of One-Time Password (OTP) verification for user authentication.
- **Deployment**: Configuration and deployment on popular platforms (e.g., Vercel for frontend, Heroku for backend).

This project is designed to help beginners understand the integration of frontend and backend technologies within the MERN stack, and how to build a simple but functional web application.
